This is an interactive client-server terminal-like portfolio.

This github repo is being deployed by netlify so there are changes from which server, the client is communicating with, so if you wish to run it locally you will need to change the address
of the server in auth.js, projects.js, deleteProject.js, addProject.js

The express server is also available in my repos [ https://github.com/Vijayadityaraj-source/Terminal-portfolio_Server ] and this is deployed as a glitch project.

### Running this repo :

Step 1: ``` npm install ```

Step 2: ``` npm start ```

This project is live at ✨ https://vijayaditya-portfolio.netlify.app ✨
